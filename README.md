# Survival-Maze
Survival-Maze it's a 3D Game made in Open-GL in which a humanoid character is supposed to find the exit of a maze in a certain amount of time. Also, on valid points on the map (in which the character can be placed in) there is a chance of an obstacle appearing. The protagonist either runs through the obstacle losing health points, or can shoot it down, making its way to the exit. I made an algorithm to create a random maze every time a player starts a new game. In order to play this game you need to download the framework from https://ocw.cs.pub.ro/courses/egc/laboratoare/01.
